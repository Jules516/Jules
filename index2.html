            <h1>SCHOOL</h1> 
            <p>I began my education at the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary School in Cavite. I started at kinder on pre-school when I was 6 years old, then I enrolled in the same school for my elementary. On my entire pre-school and elementary I was just studying, School and home are the places I always go. Because of my shyness, I didn't interact that much, but I graduated with honors in elementary. I received average grades in high school because I lacked confidence in participating in extracurricular activities. My grades were insufficient to graduate with honors, but it became my motivation during my senior year of high school. I began to believe in myself and my abilities. I graduated with honors from high school and hope to graduate with honorary degrees from PUP.</p>

            <h1>HOME</h1> 
            <p>My first residence was in Silang, Cavite. I lived there with my grandparents on my father's side, and my grandparents always looked after me because my parents were always working. As I mentioned in my education, I never play outside; instead, I play with my brother using our electronic devices. After I graduated from elementary school, we moved here in Carmona, Cavite, to an apartment with which I was unfamiliar in my first year, so when it came to school projects or activities, I always relied on my classmates. I honestly don't know my neighbors; I just see them outside and my parents are the only one who interacts with them. So, after I graduate, I plan to buy our own home and provide for my parents' needs.</p>

            <h1>HOBBIES</h1> 
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing cellphone or computer games, particularly strategy games. I also try trending games, and I always look into why they are popular. In my curiosity, I also imagined making my own video games. I always wondered how they created these graphics, what logics they used, and how MMORPGs really work. I'm currently playing play to earn games, so while I'm having fun, I'm also earning. I also want to watch movies with my family or friends because watching alone is boring, so I will only watch movies with them. In this time of pandemic, I'm looking into Korean dramas and K-pop, which I'm enjoying right now.</p>
