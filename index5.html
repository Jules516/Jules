<p1 style="color: aliceblue"> These videos were created by my friends; the first was for an activity I was doing at the time, and the other two were entirely about my closest friends. These people have a variety of characteristics, but the friends I made in senior high school and college have changed my life. They have helped me develop confidence day by day, and they are the ones who make me laugh and forget about my school problems. Even if I am separated from them in the future, I will always cherish them<br></p1>
