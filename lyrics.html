Making my way downtown
Walking fast<br>
Faces pass<br>
And I'm home-bound</p>

Staring blankly ahead<br>
Just making my way<br>
Making a way<br>
Through the crowd</p>

And I need you<br>
And I miss you<br>
And now I wonder</p>

If I could fall into the sky<br>
Do you think time would pass me by?<br>
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles<br>
If I could just see you tonight</p>

It's always times like these<br>
When I think of you<br>
And I wonder if you ever think of me<br>
'Cause everything's so wrong<br>
And I don't belong<br>
Living in your precious memory</p>

'Cause I need you<br>
And I miss you<br>
And now I wonder</p>

If I could fall into the sky<br>
Do you think time would pass me by?<br>
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles<br>
If I could just see you tonight</p>

And I, I don't wanna let you know<br>
I, I drown in your memory<br>
I, I don't wanna let this go<br>
I, I don't</p>

Making my way downtown<br>
Walking fast<br>
Faces pass<br>
And I'm home-bound</p>

Staring blankly ahead<br>
Just making my way<br>
Making a way<br>
Through the crowd</p>

And I still need you<br>
And I still miss you<br>
And now I wonder</p>

If I could fall into the sky<br>
Do you think time would pass us by?<br>
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles<br>
If I could just see you</p>

If I could fall into the sky<br>
Do you think time would pass me by?<br>
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles<br>
If I could just see you<br>
If I could just hold you tonight</p>
